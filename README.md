<h>**DS203 - Programming for Data Science**</h>

<body>The course is a soft core course required to be taken towards the completion of the AI Minor offered by <a href = "https://www.minds.iitb.ac.in/">C-MInDS, IIT Bombay</a>.
<br><br>The course was an entirely hands on practical course comprising 10 Assignments and a Course Project. I've uploaded the all the assignments and the code solutions for the same
(barring assignments 1 & 2, which were theoretical) along with my Course Project which was done by Sumit Ranjan, Ritwik Gupta and I. The datasets that I have worked on in my assignments
are listed in the Problem Statement pdf file itself.

<br>The Introduction to SQL assignment was done on IITB's own SQL server, and no pdf version of the schema or the queries to be extracted were given. However the SQL part of the 
course was taken by Prof. <a href = "https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~sudarsha/">Sudarshan S</a> and he used his own RDBMS book to teach. <a href = "https://www.db-book.com/">Here's</a> the 
link to the book. 

Copyright of the Assignments go to Prof. <a href="https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~asethi/">Amit Sethi</a>, Prof. <a href="https://www.ieor.iitb.ac.in/mhanawal">Manjesh K. Hanawal</a> and
